# Peanut Butter and Jelly, an Overview


A peanut butter and jelly sandwich is the quintessential, love it or hate it staple of American childhood lunches. It is a culture icon. But where did it come from, and what is it really?

In 1901, Julia Davis Chandler wrote in [The Boston Cooking School Magazine of Culinary Science and Domestic Economics](https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015036669904&view=1up&seq=200&q1=peanut): 
>"For variety, some day try making little sandwiches, or bread fingers, of three very thin layers of bread and two of fill- ing, one of peanut; paste, whatever brand you prefer, and currant or crab-apple jelly for the other. The combination is delicious, and, so far as I know, original."
